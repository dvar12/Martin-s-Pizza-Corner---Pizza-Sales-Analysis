# Martin's Pizza Sales Analysis Project

Welcome to the README for the Martin's Pizza Sales Analysis project! In this project, I had the opportunity to delve into the realm of data analysis by examining pizza sales data for Martin's Pizza Store. Let's dive into the details!

## Project Scope

Martin's Pizza Store sought a thorough analysis of their pizza sales spanning 7 months in 2015. With a diverse menu comprising over 32 unique pizzas categorized into 3 distinct groups, the dataset held the promise of offering valuable insights into their business operations.

## Approach

Here's how I tackled the project:

### Data Preprocessing

I initiated the analysis by cleaning and transforming the dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy. This involved adjusting data types and creating new features to enhance the analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Employing SQL queries, I conducted an in-depth exploration of the data to uncover meaningful patterns and trends. From examining sales distribution across categories to pinpointing peak sales hours, every aspect was meticulously scrutinized.

### Advanced SQL Techniques

Throughout the project, I leveraged a variety of SQL functionalities, including CRUD operations, window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and joins. These techniques facilitated dynamic data manipulation and enabled thorough analysis.

## Key Insights

Here are some of the crucial insights gleaned from the analysis:

- **Sales Trends:** By scrutinizing sales data over time, I discerned seasonal fluctuations and highlighted months of exceptional performance.
- **Menu Analysis:** Understanding customer preferences was paramount. I investigated the popularity of different pizza categories and individual pizza names, providing valuable insights for menu optimization.
- **Peak Hours:** Identifying peak sales hours assisted Martin's Pizza Store in optimizing staffing and resource allocation, ensuring efficient operations during periods of high demand.

## Conclusion

This project served as a stepping stone. Equipped with a solid foundation in SQL and data analysis, I'm enthusiastic about tackling more intricate projects and generating impactful insights for businesses.
